# SuperStore-Data-Analysis-with-SQL-Python

**SQL for Data Analysis**
In this SQL project, I utilized the samplestore dataset obtained from Kaggle as the primary data source for analysis. The project involved the execution of SQL queries in the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) platform to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of my queries.
However, instead of relying solely on pandas and numpy for data retrieval, I specifically chose to showcase my SQL skills by utilizing SQL queries for retrieving the data.


**Effective Data Visualization with Python**
To effectively visualize and present the results of my SQL queries, I leveraged the power of Python in Jupyter Notebook. By utilizing the pyodbc library, I established a connection between Jupyter Notebook and the SSMS database. This enabled me to visualize and analyze the
query outputs efficiently. Additionally, for presenting the data, I made use of the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries of Python, further enhancing the visual appeal of the analysis.


**Ensuring Security and Privacy**
I prioritized the security of sensitive information in my project. After successfully establishing the connection between Jupyter Notebook and the SSMS database, I took the necessary steps to remove the SQL login credentials. This ensured the protection of sensitive data and
maintained the integrity of the project.


**Applying Analytical Skills for Real-World Challenges**
This project provided an excellent opportunity for me to apply my analytical skills in writing SQL queries that address real-world problems and cater to specific business needs. I employed various techniques, such as date filtering, multiple text filters, adding a category column,
and modifying row values, demonstrating the versatility of my SQL skills. These skills were instrumental in conducting comprehensive data analysis, complementing the power of pandas and numpy.


**Enhancing Analytical Abilities and Driving Informed Decision-Making**
This SQL project significantly enhanced my analytical abilities and demonstrated the practical application of SQL in data analysis. By leveraging the samplestore dataset, executing SQL queries, visualizing results using Python libraries, and utilizing my analytical skills, I derived
meaningful insights that can inform decision-making in a business context. The combination of SQL and Python allowed me to showcase a comprehensive skill set, making me a well-rounded data analyst.
